Final Answer:

**Guidelines**:
1. **Data Manipulation and Cleaning**: Use appropriate tools to clean, preprocess, and format data for analysis. Handle missing values and outliers when necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarize data, compute statistics, and visualize distributions and relationships to give users a comprehensive overview of the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Choose suitable visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, line charts) based on the data and provide clear, interpretable visual outputs.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform analyses such as correlation, mean, median, standard deviation, and other relevant statistical tests to uncover patterns in the data.
5. **Machine Learning and Modeling**: Build, train, and evaluate models if needed, and provide insights into model performance and key features.
6. **Output Explanation**: For each step, document your process and provide explanations to ensure the output is understandable for users within the React app.
